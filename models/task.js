//In backend development, a model is like a blueprint for the data in your application. It defines the structure of your data and how it interacts with the database.

const mongoose = require("mongoose"); //import mongoose

const schema = mongoose.Schema; //shortcut to access mongoose Schema class

//Defining the Schema for task based of the UI
const taskSchema = new schema({
  title: String, //title of the task
  description: String, //description of the task
  tag: String, //tag associated with the task "urgent or important"
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("task", taskSchema); //Export the model to be used for request operations in the controller.
